## Overview

I am a student at the [Atlantic Technological University](https://www.atu.ie/), Galway, studying the Higher Diploma in Science in Data Analytics on a part-time basis over 2 years.  
This project is a basic demonstration of building and consuming a RESTful API using Flask. It is intended as a foundational application to showcase the following core concepts:
Building a RESTful API with Flask
Connecting the API to a database 
Performing CRUD operations via both the API and a simple web interface
Using AJAX to interact with the API from the frontend

Backend: Flask (Python)
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (with AJAX)
Database: SQLite (via SQLAlchemy)
